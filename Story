**Story**

Once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a Jamun tree which was on the banks of a river. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As days passed by, the crocodile and monkey became good friends.
One day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife.
She ate the fruits and liked them, but she was jealous, as she didnt like her husband spending so much time with the monkey.
She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkeys heart would be"
